      <h1>INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT</h1>
      <p>Our Lady of Mount Carmel High School was established in 1990 by Father John McHugh, SOLT to provide an affordable, quality, Catholic education for the young people of Benque Viejo del Carmen, Belize. The school began with only volunteer teachers and a one-room school building. Now the “miracle school” has a thriving campus, a full-time staff of Belizean teachers, and over 560 beautiful students. The Mission of MCHS is to serve all the youth in our community, especially the underprivileged, by providing a holistic education within the Catholic Tradition. MCHS is unique because of its focus on Faith, academics, and sports. Discipline and safety are additional key features of our school. In addition to our trained and passionate Belizean teachers, MCHS is also staffed by Catholic missionaries who come from all parts of the world, especially the U.S. MCHS is also characterized by having a large number of Guatemalan students from Melchor and beyond.  </p>
