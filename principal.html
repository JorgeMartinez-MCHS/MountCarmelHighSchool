      <h1>Message from the principal</h1>

      <p>Dear Mount Carmel Family, <br>
        <br>
        It is an honor and a privilege to serve as the principal of MCHS <br>
        <br>
        
        I have served in the field of education for over 33 years, 10 of them as principal at the primary school level in various schools in the Cayo district, and in the last 7 years, here at Our Lady of Mount Carmel High School.  <br>   <br>
        
        My primary passion is to serve God and I am grateful for the opportunity to serve in the role of principal at this, the best Catholic high school in the country. I consider it a blessing to serve at MCHS and I hope you too realize that MCHS is a special place. We truly have a wonderful school. Teachers strive their best to make a positive, lasting impact on their students and to lead them to success. Our teachings extend beyond the academic. The mission of MCHs is to develop the student wholly, with an emphasis on the teachings of the Catholic Church.  <br>	  <br>
        
        New and returning students, I welcome you to MCHS and I implore you to engage in learning to the best of your abilities. Be determined and you will persevere. Treat each other with kindness and respect and follow the positive influences that are around you. Parents, I ask that you continue to support your children. Be patient and understanding with the young people, love them and form them and always be present in their lives. <br>   <br>
        
        As your principal, I commit to live and lead the school by the values of our Catholic teachings and to make the best decisions for you, our students. I pray that we will walk together in the path of Christ. <br>   <br>
        
        I look forward to another great year. Go Crusaders!
        <br>
        <br>
        
        
        Yours in Christ,
        <br>
        <br>

        Ms. Anselma Rosado
